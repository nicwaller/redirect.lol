<h1>About redirect.lol</h1>

Create HTTP redirects using only DNS records.

<h2>Why?</h2>

Sometimes you have a domain or subdomain and you want visitors to get redirected somewhere else.
First-time webmasters often
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/9444055/190298">assume</a>
this is a simple matter of setting up some DNS records.
However, DNS doesn't have a "redirect" record type because DNS knows nothing about HTTP --
it operates at a lower level of the network stack!

<h2>How?</h2>

redirect.lol is a very simple webserver that only serves redirects.
When it receives a request, it performs a DNS lookup to decide where the visitor should be redirected.

DNS-->redirect.lol:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo
redirect.lol->Visitor:HTTP 302 Found\nLocation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo">
