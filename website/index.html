<h1>About redirect.lol</h1>

Create HTTP redirects using only DNS records.

<h2>Why?</h2>

Sometimes you have a domain or subdomain and you want visitors to get redirected somewhere else.
First-time webmasters often
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/9444055/190298">assume</a>
this is a simple matter of setting up some DNS records.
However, DNS doesn't have a "redirect" record type because DNS knows nothing about HTTP --
it operates at a lower level of the network stack!

<h2>How?</h2>

redirect.lol is a very simple webserver that only serves redirects.
When it receives a request, it performs a DNS lookup to decide where the visitor should be redirected.

<img src="flow-simple.svg" alt="title redirect.lol (simple HTTP)
Visitor->DNS:lookup foo.net
DNS->Visitor:CNAME redirect.lol
Visitor->redirect.lol:GET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: foo.net
redirect.lol-->DNS:lookup TXT _redirect.foo.net
DNS-->redirect.lol:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo
redirect.lol->Visitor:HTTP 302 Found\nLocation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo">

<h2>What about SSL/TLS?</h2>

Using the <a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#on-demand-tls">on-demand TLS</a> feature of
<a href="https://caddyserver.com">Caddy webserver</a> it's possible for redirect.lol to serve HTTP redirects with a signed x509 certificate.

<img src="flow-https.svg" alt="title redirect.lol (HTTPS)
Visitor->DNS:lookup foo.net
DNS->Visitor:CNAME redirect.lol
Visitor->redirect.lol:TLS+SNI servername=foo.net
redirect.lol->ACME:request cert for foo.net
ACME-->redirect.lol:challenge request
redirect.lol-->ACME:challenge response
ACME->redirect.lol:signed x509 certificate
redirect.lol->Visitor:TLS header (with x509 certificate for foo.net)
Visitor->redirect.lol:GET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: foo.net
redirect.lol-->DNS:lookup TXT _redirect.foo.net
DNS-->redirect.lol:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo
redirect.lol->Visitor:HTTP 302 Found\nLocation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo
">

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

What happens if this DNS record is missing? Example: <a href="http://bad.redirect.lol">http://bad.redirect.lol</a>

You'll see an error something like this:

<pre><code>
    To enable redirect, create a DNS TXT record at _redirect.bad.redirect.lol.
    No response or failed TXT lookup for _redirect.bad.redirect.lol
</code></pre>
